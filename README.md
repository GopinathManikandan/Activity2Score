This project applies machine learning to predict students' exam scores based on activity-related data personally created and 
curated for this task. It demonstrates a complete workflow from raw data to a trained model with performance evaluation'.

--- Key Features ---

1) Custom-built dataset: enhanced_exam_score_dataset.csv

2) Data preprocessing: handling missing values and feature scaling

3) Regression modeling using Random Forest Regressor

4) Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

5) Performance evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² Score

6) Model saved using joblib for reuse

--- Tech Stack ---

1) Python, Jupyter Notebook
2) Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, joblib
